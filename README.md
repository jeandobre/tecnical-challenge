Backend JVM Software Engineer - Technical Challenge

To solve this challenge I decide to use only Java in a Maven project.

With little time I decided not add to project a library as Vert.x that I never have used.

I created One Entity called Person and Three validators as domain services and one application service that instanciate and manage the threads flow.

The main class is the more "dirt" at all.

To run you have to:
 - mvn package
 - mvn exec:java

Or just:
 - Open in IntelliJ as Maven project and run the Main file
